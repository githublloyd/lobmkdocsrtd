Welcome to the ERP Steps Recorder Knowledge Hub!

This site is created using MkDocs, ReadTheDocs.io, Node.js, and the Microsoft Steps Recorder.
This is a minimal viable product produced for the Version 1 Hackathon 2018.

## How to use

* Use the Microsoft Steps Recorder on your laptop to record a process.
* Extract the file, edit it in Mirosoft Word to add or remove items you want, save it as .docx.
* Start the Node.js application and upload the .docx file to translate the .docx file to a .md file. Give it 30 seconds or so to parse the file.
* Hit the 'Push to GitHub' button to upload the file to the ERP GitHub repository and watch the Read The Docs website update in realtime using webhooks.
