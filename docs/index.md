## How to use

* Use the Microsoft Steps Recorder on your laptop to record a process.
* Edit that file in Microsoft Word to add or remove items you want, save as .docx
* Start the Node.js application and upload the .docx file to translate the .docx file to a .md file.
* Hit the 'Push to GitHub' button to upload the file to the ERP GitHub repository and watch the Read The Docs website update in realtime using webhooks.
